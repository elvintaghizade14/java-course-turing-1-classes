## The task

#### Create a Java console module_01.app for booking plane tickets

#### The description

Create a console module_01.app that provides an interface for searching and booking plane tickets in an infinite loop (
before the passenger chooses the `exit` command).

#### Teamwork

In this project, all students are divided into groups of three.There is a list of tasks to be done for each team member.
The rest of the tasks can be assigned by the team members themselves. Team members can decide for themselves who will
perform the #1, #2 and #3 tasks.

#### The module_01.app's main menu

The main menu which the passenger sees upon opening the module_01.app should have the following features:

1. **Online-board**. Shows information about all flights from Kiev in the next 24 hours. The main menu will be displayed
   again afterward.

2. **Show the flight info**. The passenger is prompted to enter the flight id. Then the following window depicts all the
   information about this particular flight: the date, time, destination point and the amount of free seats. The main
   menu will be displayed again afterward.

3. **Search and book a flight**. The passenger is prompted to enter the following information: destination, date, number
   of people (how many tickets to buy). After that, the program must search for flights that meet the specified
   conditions (there must be enough seats for all passengers). All found flights should be displayed on the screen.
   After that, the passenger can choose one of the found flights by specifying its serial number or return to the main
   menu (selecting item 0). If the passenger decides to book a flight, he will need to enter the names and surnames of
   all passengers.

4. **Cancel the booking**. The passenger is prompted to enter the booking id. If such a booking has been found, it will
   be cancelled. The main menu is then displayed again. The passenger can cancel any booking.

5. **My flights**. The passenger is prompted to enter his full name. A list of all bookings made by the passenger or in
   which the passenger is a passenger is then displayed.

6. **Exit**. Shuts down the application

#### Technical requirements:

- The application must have a standard three-layer structure - for each entity it must have Controller, Service and DAO
  classes.
- Unit tests must be written for each controller, service and DAO classes.
- To work with the console (main menu), a separate class must be created, which will access the necessary controllers to
  get information. Controllers can access services, services from DAO. There should be no direct access to services or
  DAO from the console class.
- The rest of the entities/classes should also be broken down into corresponding packages.
- You should use the features of Java 8 wherever possible.
- In case of impossible actions of the passenger (for example, if he selects of a non-existent menu item), throw your
  own exception class. Intercept it in the application above to make the program continue its work.
- The "database" of the application should be stored in a text/binary file next to the application. When launching the
  application, the data from the files should be written to the collections in the DAO classes.
- The application should have a large automatically generated flight database, which should be copied to a file and read
  by the application at startup.
- It is enough to make all the flights from Kiev, they will differ only in the destination.
- When exiting the application, all the changes must be written to the save file. When restarting the application, the
  collections in DAO must be re-initialized with data from the save file.

#### The task for studentEntity №1

- Create a class to work with the console

#### The task for studentEntity №2

- Create a controller, a service and DAO for the flights

#### The task for studentEntity №3

- Create a controller, a service and DAO for the bookings

#### Organization of the workflow:

- The code of the team members must be in the same repository.
- You will need to set up GitLab so that the `master` branch would be protected and nobody could commit to it. You can
  read about how to do such
  thing [here](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/admin/developer-workflow/configuring-protected-branches-and-required-status-checks).
- You need to create a new branch each time you make changes in the project and then Pull Request, based on its changes.
  You can find more details about the
  process [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
- You will learn to commit Code review of the code which was written by your colleagues. The project must be set up in
  such a manner, so that every Pull Request is able to merge into master after it gets Approve from other team
  members. You can find the description of setting up the
  repository [here](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/ ).

#### Non-obligatory task, advanced level:

- Create a separate class for logging, write down all the actions of the use in a log file.
- Before showing the main menu authorize the passenger - he must enter his login and password. If such a passenger
  exists the main menu is displayed and вся work occurs on behalf of this user. For example section **My
  bookings** displays information about all the bookings of the current passenger. A new section is added to main menu *
  *End session**, it makes a logout, so that login and password of another passenger can be entered.
- Add flight not only from Kiev but also between other cities. Finding connecting flights with connections not longer
  than 12 hours.

#### Good luck!
