# The 'Happy Family' mini-project keeps striking!

The idea of the project is to describe the structure of a family while taking into account that every human has
relatives and the family members can change over time.

# Layer DAO

## The task

Improve the project:

- create the DAO layer
- create `FamilyController` classes and `FamilyService` for work with objects like `Family`.

#### Technical requirements:

- Create interface to access class data  `Family` - `FamilyDao` with next methods:
    - `getAllFamilies` - returns an indexed list of all families    (`List`).
    - `getFamilyByIndex` (accepts the family index from general list) - returns the family by the specified index. In
      case you have requested an element with a non-existent index, return     `null`.
    - `deleteFamily` (accepts the index) - deletes family with a specified index, if such an index exists;
      returns `true` if the removal took place, `false` - if not.
    - `deleteFamily` (takes on the `Family` type) - deletes a family if one exists on the list; returns `true` if the
      removal took place, `false` - if not.
    - `saveFamily` (accepts the `Family` type) - updates an existing family in Database if that one already exists,
      saves at the end of the list - if not.
- Create `CollectionFamilyDao` class: class have to include `List<Family>`, where all the families will be kept (it's
  going to be our database) and implement the `FamilyDao` interface.
- Create `FamilyService` class, which should contain the `FamilyDao` field to access stored data.
- `FamilyService` class must implement the methods (if in `FamilyDao` there are not enough methods for the
  implementation - add them and implement them in `CollectionFamilyDao`):
    - `getAllFamilies` - to get a list of all the families.
    - `displayAllFamilies` - to put all the families on the screen (in the indexed list) with all the family members.
    - `getFamiliesBiggerThan` - to find family with number of people **more** than (takes the number of people and
      returns all families where the number of people is greater than specified); displays the information on the
      screen.
    - `getFamiliesLessThan` - to find family with number of people **less** than (takes the number of people and returns
      all families where the number of people is less than specified);
    - `countFamiliesWithMemberNumber` - to calculate the number of families with the number of people equal to the
      number of transferred people.
    - `createNewFamily` - create a new family ( takes two parameters of Human type) - create a new family, saves in
      database.
    - `deleteFamilyByIndex` - to delete a family by its index in the list - deletes the family from database.
    - `bornChild` - to give a birth to a child's family (takes `Family` and two `String` types: masculine and
      feminine) - a new child is born in the given family taking into account the parents' data, the information about
      the family is updated in the database; the method returns the renewed family. If the child is born a boy, it is
      given a male name, if the girl is female.
    - `adoptChild` - to adopt child (takes two types: `Family`, `Human`)- the child is kept in the given family, the
      information about the family is updated in the database; the method returns the renewed family.
    - `deleteAllChildrenOlderThen` - to delete all children older than (takes int) - in all families, children over the
      specified age are removed and the information is updated in the database.
    - `count` - returns the number of families in the database.
    - `getFamilyById` - takes the family index, returns `Family` as specified index.
    - `getPets` - takes the family index, returns the list of pets that live in the family.
    - `addPet` - takes family index and `Pet` parameter - adds a new pet to the family, updates the data in the
      database.
- Create `FamilyController` class, which should contain `FamilyService` field to access the application's business logic
  methods.
- `FamilyController` class must contain the same methods as those in the `FamilyService`.
- In the Main class call up all the methods from `FamilyController`, to demonstrate their performance.
- Cover all methods from `FamilyService` unit tests.
