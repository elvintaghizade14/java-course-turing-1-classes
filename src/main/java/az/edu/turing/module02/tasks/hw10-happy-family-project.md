# The 'Happy Family' mini-project keeps striking!

The idea of the project is to describe the structure of a family while taking into account that every human has
relatives and the family members can change over time.

# Working with I/O streams. Reading and writing to files

## The task

Improve the project: add the ability to work with the file system.

#### Technical requirements:

- Add to the application the ability to save data locally to your computer.
- Add the ability to load previously saved data (new item in the main menu instead of generating test data).
- To download data in the `FamilyService` and `FamilyDao` classes, add `loadData` method which accepts
  the `List<Family> families` and downloads it to our database.
  -For each action, add an item to the main menu.

The list of families with all data should be saved/downloaded.

#### Not a necessary task of advanced complexity:

- Create a separate service (class) for logging, which will have 2 methods: `info()` (log information message)
  and `error()` (log error). Both methods accept the message for logging, but give a different format: 01/01/2019 15:
  35 [DEBUG]/[ERROR] `message`.
- Add a call to the `logger.info()` method in all methods `CollectionFamilyDao`  with an info message such
  as `receiving a family list`, `adding a new family`, `deleting a family`, etc.
- When handling exceptions, log them using the method `logger.error()`.
- When processing exceptions, log them using the `application.log`.
- Make sure that the recording is always done at the end of the file from a new line.
