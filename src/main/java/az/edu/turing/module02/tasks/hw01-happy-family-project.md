# "A happy family" Mini-Project

Assignment: describe the structure of a family, take into account that each member has blood relatives and the
composition of the family tends to fluctuate.
Before you get to the "Collections" topic - all the homeworks must be done using arrays (**DO NOT**
use  `List`, `Set`, `Map` interfaces, unless the assignment says you to.)

# Objects

## Task

Create and describe these classes:  (`Pet`), (`Human`). Create constructors for the classes you have written. Create
the `Main` class and the examples of the described classes in it.

#### Technical requirements:

- Describe the Pet with the following fields:
    - (`species`)
    - (`nickname`)
    - (`age`)
    - (`trickLevel`) (a whole number from 1 to 100)
    - (`habits`) (array of strings)
- Describe and implement the following methods for Pet:
    - (`eat`) (method displays a message 'I am eating')
    - (`respond`) (method displays a message 'Hello, owner. I am - [the name of the pet]. I miss you!')
    - (`foul`) (method displays a message 'I need to cover it up')
- Describe Human with the following fields:
    - (`name`)
    - (`surname`)
    - date of birth (`year`), number
    - IQ level (`iq`) (a whole number from 1 to 100)
    - (`pet`) (object type Pet)
    - (`mother`) (object type Human)
    - (`father`) (object type Human)
    - Schedule of non-working activities (`schedule`) (2d array: [day of the week] x [type of the activity])
- Describe and implement the following methods for Human:
    - (`greetPet`)("Hello, [the name of the pet]")
    - (`describePet`): (display the information about your pet: "I have an [species] is [age] years old, he
      is [very sly]>50/[almost not sly]<50".
- Redefine the  `toString()` method for bot classes;
    - The Pet class must display the following
      message: `dog{nickname='Rock', age=5, trickLevel=75, habits=[eat, drink, sleep]}`, where `dog` = species;
    - The Human class must display the following
      message: `Human{name='Michael', surname='Karleone', year=1977, iq=90, mother=Jane Karleone, father=Vito Karleone, pet=dog{nickname='Rock', age=5, trickLevel=75, habits=[eat, drink, sleep]}}`
- In class `Pet` create constructors:
    - constructor which describes the pet's species a nickname
    - constructor which describes all the fields for the pet
    - empty constructor
- In class`Human` create constructors:
    - constructor which describes the name, surname and the date of birth
    - constructor which describes the name, surname, date of birth, father and mother
    - constructor which describes all the fields
    - empty constructor
- In the Main class create several families, so that every class uses all the available constructors. Display data about
  every person.
- In the Main class: create a mother, father, child and his pet. Specify all the needed links (for child to his parents
  and to the pet), in order to form a full family. Call all available methods for the child (including  `toString()`
  method) and his pet.

#### Non-obligatory task with advanced complexity:

Describe and implement the  (`feedPet`) method in the Human class, which accepts a logical boolean type as a
parameter ("isn't it time for feeding "). If it is time - the owner feeds the pet, if not - the trick level is compared
to a pseudorandom number of 0-100 using `java.util.Random` and the owner feeds the pet if the trick level is greater
than the generated number. The method should display the following
result: (`Hm... I will feed Jack's [animal name]/`/`I think Jack is not hungry.`) and return a boolean
value (`true/false`) - whether the feeding happened or not.
